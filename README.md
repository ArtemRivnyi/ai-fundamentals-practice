## üî¨ Lab Details

### Lab1: Data Clustering

This lab focuses on data clustering techniques using `K-Means` and `Mean Shift` algorithms. It demonstrates how to load data, determine optimal cluster numbers using the silhouette score, and visualize the clustering results. The project uses `pandas` for data handling and `scikit-learn` for clustering algorithms.

**Key Concepts:**

*   K-Means Clustering
*   Mean Shift Clustering
*   Silhouette Score for optimal cluster determination
*   Data visualization with `matplotlib`

**Key Files:**

*   `main.py`: Python script implementing the clustering logic and visualization.
*   `lab01.csv`: Sample dataset used for clustering.
*   `lab01.ods`: OpenDocument Spreadsheet version of the sample dataset.

### Lab2: Genetic Algorithms

This lab implements a basic genetic algorithm to find the optimal solution for a given objective function. It utilizes the `DEAP` (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) framework to define individuals, populations, fitness functions, and genetic operators (crossover, mutation, selection).

**Key Concepts:**

*   Genetic Algorithms fundamentals
*   Fitness function definition
*   Selection, Crossover, and Mutation operators
*   `DEAP` framework usage

**Key Files:**

*   `main.py`: Python script containing the genetic algorithm implementation.

### Lab3: Neural Networks (MNIST Classification)

This lab demonstrates the implementation of a simple neural network using `Keras` for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It covers data loading, preprocessing (normalization, one-hot encoding), model creation, training, evaluation, and saving the trained model.

**Key Concepts:**

*   Neural Network architecture (Sequential model)
*   Dense layers and activation functions (`relu`, `softmax`)
*   Categorical Cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
*   MNIST dataset classification
*   Model training and evaluation
*   Model persistence (`.keras` format)

**Key Files:**

*   `main.py`: Python script for building, training, and evaluating the neural network.
*   `mnist_model.h5`: A pre-trained Keras model (HDF5 format).
*   `my_model.keras`: The trained Keras model saved after execution.
